        /* The for loop is a common choice for iterating over a range of values or the elements of an array. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. Here's a basic example:*/ 
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
// The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It's useful for working with objects and their keys:
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
// The for...of loop is used to iterate over the values of iterable objects like arrays and strings. It's a more concise way to loop through elements:
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

for (const fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit); // Outputs apple, banana, cherry
}
/* . Loop Control Statements:
JavaScript provides loop control statements that allow you to modify the loop's behavior:

break: Terminates the loop and continues with the next code block.
continue: Skips the current iteration and continues to the next one.
Here's an example of using break and continue:*/ 
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 3) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i is 3
    }
    console.log(i); // Outputs 0, 1, 2
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 3) {
        continue; // Skip the iteration when i is 3
    }
    console.log(i); // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 4
}
/*Nested Loops
You can also nest loops inside each other to create more complex iteration patterns. For example, you can use nested loops to work with multi-dimensional arrays or create grid-like structures.*/
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        console.log("i: " + i + ", j: " + j);
    }
}
