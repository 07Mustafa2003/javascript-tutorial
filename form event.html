    <!-- Form events in JavaScript are crucial for creating interactive web forms. They allow you to capture and respond to user input and interactions with HTML forms. Here, we'll explore form events in more detail: -->
    <!-- 1. Form Elements:
Before diving into form events, let's briefly cover the key form elements you'll work with:

<form>: The container for form controls.
<input>: Text input fields for various data types (text, number, email, etc.).
<textarea>: Multiline text input.
<select>: Dropdown menus for selecting options.
<button>: Buttons to submit or reset the form.
<label>: Labels for form controls to improve accessibility. -->

2. Common Form Events:
JavaScript provides several events that are frequently used with forms:

submit: This event occurs when a form is submitted, either by clicking a submit button or pressing Enter within a text field.
reset: This event occurs when a form is reset, usually by clicking a reset button.
input: This event occurs when an input element's value changes, typically triggered by the user typing or selecting a value.
change: This event is often used with select boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes, and it fires when the user selects a different option. -->
